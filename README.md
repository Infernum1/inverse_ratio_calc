An inverse sin, cos and tan calculator. Just a fun little project I tried because I was bored.

How to use:
1. Decide what ratio you want to use (sin, cos or tan)
2. Accordingly, input the values of the two sides when you are prompted
3. Let the magic happen and you'll see a triangle (which should be similar to what you have) pop in front of you, and the measure of "theta" (approx.) will be displayed too in the terminal.

This can be used to get the measure of an angle when all that is known to u are two sides **of a right-angled triangle.**
